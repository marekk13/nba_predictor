Predict NBA game results using machine learning models. Analyzes 7 seasons (2017/18‚Äì2023/24) with advanced feature engineering and model comparison.

## üìñ Project Overview  
**Key Challenges**:
- Temporal data aggregation for 8,281 games - preventing data leakage
- Imbalanced precision (Home: 72-79% vs Away: 44-52%)

**Core Components**:
- Data pipeline with rolling averages and PCA
- Logistic Regression vs Neural Network comparison
- Advanced stats (TS%, ORtg) as key predictors

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  
### Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üìÅ Dataset
### Structure
- **8,281 games** (5 seasons training / 2 seasons testing)
- **78 features** including:
  - Basic stats: PTS, REB, AST
  - Advanced metrics: TS%, PER, ORtg
  - Contextual: Win streaks, rest days

### Sources
- Primary: basketball-reference.com - used [luke-lite's scraping notebook](https://github.com/luke-lite/NBA-Web-Scraper/blob/main/NBA-Web-Scraper-Notebook.ipynb)
- Supplementary: Team rankings, form indicators; [kyleskom's scraper](https://github.com/kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting/tree/master/src/Process-Data) was improved and run to get the data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
### Feature Engineering
1. **Temporal Features**:
   - 20/30/40-game rolling averages
   - Season-long cumulative stats
2. **Contextual Enhancements**:
   - Win/loss streaks
   - Days-rest differentials

## üìä Results
### Performance Comparison
| Metric            | Logistic Regression | Neural Network |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Accuracy**      | 63.18%              | **63.72%**     |
| Precision (Home)  | 72%                 | 79%            |
| Recall (Home)     | 70%                 | 68%            |
| Precision (Away)  | 52%                 | 44%            |

### Key Findings
- ~7 percentage point accuracy boost over baseline (home win probability)
- Best results were achieved using advanced stats and deleting basic stats
- PCA reduces training time, but has no significant influence on the results

## üß† Insights
### Model Tradeoffs
```plaintext
Logistic Regression:
+ Interpretable coefficients
- Limited non-linear patterns

Neural Network:
+ Captures complex interactions
- Requires GPU for optimal training
```

---

## üöß Limitations
- No use of player availability data
- Limited to box score statistics
- 74 missing records in raw data due to inconsistencies in scrapers

---

## üîÆ Future Directions
```plaintext
1. Integrate injury reports
2. Experiment with Bayesian methods
3. Address class imbalance via focal loss
```
